Implemented RAG using Langflow

Data was collected using Selenium webdriver from here ---> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pxxthik/the-cocktail-db-recipe-collection 

The data is stored in AstraDB as vector embeddings and used Cohere AI to implement RAG

Cocktail Rag.json in RAG folder can be imported to your Langflow project.
Use Astra and Cohere apis accordingly to create the flow.

Additionally, RAG folder contains images and a video for the demonstration of this RAG application.
